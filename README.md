# Independent-ANARewardTicket

I am a big fan of reward ticket and ANA offers arguably the best reward ticket program between US and Japan/China.
ANA issues reward ticket at arbitrary, most likely driven by their paid ticket availability so there is not a good way to find available during a time frame besides web search.
This script runs web scraping technique on ANA website, obtain available flight data with award ticket, and finally send all results during a specific period to a list of email addresses. The detailed instruction on how to run is included in the script.
